Goals
----
- Setu should absorb all complexities.
- Client and Agent should be light and simple as far as possible.

Setu responsibilties

Element Identification
- When an element is created in client using elementX API, Setu should create a local object.
- The above object should have identified=False set.
- When someone takes first action on this, then a find call should happen to the agent API. At that time only the agent side object is created.
- This means idendifyIfNull kind of methods should be present in Setu and not in agent.
- The agent side element would be tied to one of the identifiers described in OR relationship in locators.
- Any re-identification logic should be present in Setu. For this to effectively take place, Setu element
should store all identifiers, when element is identified, it should store the successful one separately.

Unsupported API
---------------
- Setu should return not supported error Jsons to improve performance and prevent unnecessary back and forth traffic for unsupported methods for an automator/element.
- 

Actions
- For any actions e.g. enterText, if 2-3 calls are wrapped, they need to be present in Setu.
- Only granular calls would be present in agent.

Exceptions
----------
